# Voice Recorder
Voice recording application. The goal is to reflect the basic skills of iOS app development. The design project is taken from Behance.

## Technologies:
* **Swift 5 + UIKit** (without using storyboard).
* **AVFoundation** for recording and playing audio files.
* **Realm** database to save settings (it might have been worth using UserDefaults, but there are bugs with caches).
* **MVVM** pattern & **SOLID-based** architecture.
